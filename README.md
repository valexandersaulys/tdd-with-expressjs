# TDD (Test Driven Development) Playground


## Goals

Inspired in part by TDD, but also with my own spin on it.

> Everything you write should have a purpose and you should understand
> everything fully -- with running test cases -- on how this works

(unnamed Qs no relevant here: why is this useful, who is it intended
for, etc. )

First Q: what does this do?

Second Q: what views or api routes are required to do this? what do
each of them do? What happens if they don't work


Then we write integration tests -- from these, we springboard into
unit tests


## Other Ancillary Goals

Better understand how Jest works

Learn how Typescript works
